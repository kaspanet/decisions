# Repository Topics

This document describes the topics being used in Kaspa GitHub repositories.

---
#### TL; DR

GitHub repositories are tagged with the topics *Core*, *App*, *Research* and *Doc*.

---

## Motivation
GitHub does not allow organizing repositories into hierarchies. Therefore, the more repositories are added, the less intuitive is for a newcomer to understand where to find what they are looking for.

Using *topics* makes the role of each repository clear.
